C# library for Lego Mindstorms EV3

Fork from this fantastic library: http://www.monobrick.dk/software/ev3firmware/

Goal is to add game-related features to MonoBrik:
- LCD wrap mode (a la Asteroids)
- Optimized pixel operations (work in progress)

Misc:
- fixed LCD pixel boundaries bug in original library
